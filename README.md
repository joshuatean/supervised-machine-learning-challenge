# supervised-machine-learning-challenge

## Purpose of the Challenge
The purpose of the challenge is to use the provided data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans, and comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

## Prediction
Upon reviewing the csv file, there appears to be a linear relationship between particularly interest rate and the loan status. I believe that the Logistic Regression model will perform better than the Random Forest model as it performs better with numerical data.

## Outcome
From the analysis above, both models have a very similar outcome. The Logistic Regression scored slightly lower with the training score, but slightly higher with the testing score. As predicted, the logistic regression proved to be the higher performer, running and completing almost instantly in 0.4s vs the Random Forest Classifier which took 22.1s.
